    "### Dev notes:\n",
    "There are roughly two ways of implementing what's happening in this notebook:\n",
    "1. We could call the `https://online-go.com/api/v1/players/<player_id>/games` endpoint in the OGS API for a specified `player_id`.\n",
    "2. We could find all the game id numbers for a given player (via method 1), then call the `https://online-go.com/api/v1/games/<game_id>` endpoint repeatedly for each game id.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we choose method 1. In principal the endpoint in method 2 contains more detailed information about each individual game, including a JSON representation of the actual moves. However, method 1 involves fewer API requests as it collects data on 10 games per request, while method 2 requests a single game at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Method 2 is implicitly invoked when running `games_dump.ipynb` as the game moves can only be accessed through the `https://online-go.com/api/v1/games/<game_id>` endpoint. A more detailed raw stats dump is performed there in case it is useful."
